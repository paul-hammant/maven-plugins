Usage

  The Maven Linkcheck Plugin allows you to generate a Linkcheck report of your documentation generated by the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin}Maven Site Plugin}}.

* Running It As A Maven Report

  You need to configure the reporting section in your POM like other Maven reporting plugins, i.e.:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-linkcheck-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          ...
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 Here is a simple report:

[./images/sample.png] Sample report

* Running It As A Maven Plugin

  The Linkcheck Plugin can be put into a project's <<<pom.xml>>> as follows:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-linkcheck-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          ...
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

  In this case, no report will be created, but the linkcheck files
  will be created in the <<<target/linkcheck>>> directory.

* Real life configuration

  If you want to see a real life configuration you can have a look at
  {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/site/trunk/pom.xml}the POM for the Maven site}}.
  There is a profile near the end called <linkcheck>.
