Maven Multi Module Configuration

  With a multi modules build, you cannot simply use <<<mvn site-deploy>>>: you must stage your site first.

  Cli commands to use:

+------------+
mvn -Preporting site site:stage
mvn scm-publish:publish-scm
+------------+

  These commands work well with mono-module too, even if mono-module could permit some optimizations (everything can be run
  in only one Maven invocation).

* Avoiding Extra Path During Staging

  When staging the site, sometimes extra directories appear between <<<target/staging>>> and the effective root of the site:
  this is caused by the auto-detection algorithm of site root, which cannot detect at which level to stop.

  This can be fixed by configuring the {{{/plugins/maven-site-plugin/stage-mojo.html#topSiteURL}site plugin's topSiteURL parameter}}
  (added in version 3.3) with top distribution management site url in a parent pom:

+-----+
  <distributionManagement>
    <site>
      <id>site</id>
      <url>scm:svn:https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/sandbox/bimargulies/site-test</url>
    </site>
  </distributionManagement>
  <build>
    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
          <configuration>
            <topSiteURL>scm:svn:https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/sandbox/bimargulies/site-test</topSiteURL>
          </configuration>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>
  </build>
