Maven Mono Module Configuration

  <<This easy to use and optimized (no staging) configuration works only for mono module Maven build>>

  With following configuration you can simply run: <<<mvn site-deploy>>>

+-----------------------
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
      <configuration>
        <skipDeploy>true</skipDeploy><!-- don't deploy site with maven-site-plugin -->
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-scm-publish-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
      <configuration>
        <content>\${project.reporting.outputDirectory}</content><!-- mono-module doesn't require site:stage -->
      </configuration>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>scm-publish</id>
          <phase>site-deploy</phase><!-- deploy site with maven-scm-publish-plugin -->
          <goals>
            <goal>publish-scm</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
