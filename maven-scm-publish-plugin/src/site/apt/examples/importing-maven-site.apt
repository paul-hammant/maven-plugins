Importing maven.apache.org Content to Svn

  This plugin has been created to enable conversion of Maven components documentation
  to Apache CMS, based on svnpubsub: see {{{http://www.apache.org/dev/cms.html}documentation}}.

  Once new content can be published with the plugin, existing content needs to be imported.

  A little shell script has been used to import a component with all its versions independently of
  any site generation phase or components' pom.xml:

+--------
# configuration
ORIG_PATH=/www/maven.apache.org
DEST_SVN_BASE=https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/maven/content

ARTIFACT=maven-clean-plugin
DIR=plugins/${ARTIFACT}
VERSIONS="2.3 2.4 2.4.1 2.5"


# initialize ${DIR}-LATEST entry in svn
svn -m "prepare ${ARTIFACT} documentation publication" mkdir ${DEST_SVN_BASE}/${DIR}-LATEST

# publish existing content for each version in ${VERSIONS}
for VERSION in ${VERSIONS}
do

  echo "  ========== ${ARTIFACT} ${VERSION} =========="
  mvn -e scm-publish:publish-scm \
    -Dscmpublish.content=${ORIG_PATH}/${DIR}-${VERSION} \
    -Dscmpublish.pubScmUrl=scm:svn:${DEST_SVN_BASE}/${DIR}-LATEST \
    -Dscmpublish.checkinComment="published documentation for ${ARTIFACT} version ${VERSION}" \
  && \
  svn cp ${DEST_SVN_BASE}/${DIR}-LATEST ${DEST_SVN_BASE}/${DIR}-${VERSION} -m "releasing ${ARTIFACT} ${VERSION} documentation"

done
