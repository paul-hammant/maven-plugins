Using the XML Schema Verifications 1.0.0

  The Verifications XSD is located {{{http://maven.apache.org/xsd/verifications-1.0.0.xsd}here}}.

  Your favorite IDE probably supports validation and/or syntax highlighting for
  XML files by using XSD schemas. For this to work you need to specify the
  schema in your <<<verifications.xml>>> file:

+-----+
<verifications xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/verifications/1.0.0"
               xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
               xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/verifications/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/verifications-1.0.0.xsd">
...
</verifications>
