Usage

  To verify file system resources during your build, add the Verifier Plugin in
  your <<<pom.xml>>> under the <<<build>>> section. You will also need to
  create a {{{./verifications.html}<<<verifications.xml>>>}} file that contains
  the verification rules. Add the path to that file to the
  <<<verificationFile>>> configuration element.

<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-verifier-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <verificationFile>src/test/verifier/verifications-test.xml</verificationFile>
        </configuration>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>main</id>
            <phase>verify</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>verify</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>

+---------

  The Verifier Plugin will fail your build if the verification rules found in
  the <<<verificationFile>>> fails. If you do not want the Verifier Plugin to
  fail your build you can set the configuration element <<<\<failOnError\>>>>
  to <<<false>>>.

  For a sample verifications file, see {{{./examples/sample-verifications.html}Sample Verifications}}.
