     <question>What is Jarsigner?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>
         You can read more about this tool in the offical guide:

   <faq id="single-archive">
     <question>Is it possible to sign a single archive file?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>
         Signing or verifying a Java archive which is neither a project artifact
         nor an attached artifact can be done by using the <code>archive</code> parameter
         of the <a href="sign-mojo.html"><code>sign</code></a> and <a href="verify-mojo.html"><code>verify</code></a> goals. If
         this parameter is set, the goals will process the specified archive and will not process any project
         artifacts.

   <faq id="unsign">
     <question>How can I unsign JARs before re-signing them with my key?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>
         To remove any existing signatures from the JARs before signing with your own key, simply set the parameter
         <a href="sign-mojo.html#removeExistingSignatures"><code>removeExistingSignatures</code></a> of the
         <a href="sign-mojo.html"><code>sign</code></a> mojo to <code>true</code>. The resulting JAR will then appear
         to be signed exactly once.

   <faq id="sign_and_assembly">
        <question>Why if I want to sign an artifact and then assembly there is some problem under windows?</question>
        <answer>
          <p>
            To fix the problem, just move the assembly execution so it comes <strong>after</strong> the jarsigner execution in the pom.
          </p>
          <p>
           The whole story of the problem can be found in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MJARSIGNER-13">MJARSIGNER-13</a> issue.
