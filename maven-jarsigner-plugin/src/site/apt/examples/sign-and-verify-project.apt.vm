Sign and verify a project

  If you need to sign a project artifact and all attached artifacts and want
  to verify the signatures afterwards, just configure the sign and verify goal
  appropriately in your <<<pom.xml>>> for the signing to occur automatically
  during the package phase and for the verification to occur during the verify
  phase.

<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jarsigner-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>sign</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>sign</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
          <execution>
            <id>verify</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>verify</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>

  Note: The sign goal requires at least the alias to use for signing. This alias
  can be passed using the command line like <<<-Djarsigner.alias="Alias Name">>>
  or set as a property in the <<<settings.xml>>> file when not configured in the POM.
