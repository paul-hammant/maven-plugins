Configuring Source Plugin

 To customize the plugin, you can change its configuration parameters in your POM, as shown below:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-source-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <outputDirectory>/absolute/path/to/the/output/directory</outputDirectory>
          <finalName>filename-of-generated-jar-file</finalName>
          <attach>false</attach>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 The generated jar file will be named by the value of the <<<finalName>>> plus "-sources" if it is the main sources. Otherwise,
 it would be <<<finalName>>> plus "-test-sources" if it is the test sources. It will be generated in the specified
 <<<outputDirectory>>>. The <<<attach>>> parameter specifies whether the java sources will be attached to the artifact list of
 the project.
